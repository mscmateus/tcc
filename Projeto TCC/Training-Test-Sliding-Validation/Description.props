# Description (required)
Description=The training-test sliding validation method preserves the chronological order of the instances in the construction of the training and test bases. This method is defined by two parameters: (i) t which represents the percentage of instances that make up the training base; and (ii) r that represents the percentage of immediately subsequent instances that form the test basis and, consequently, the size of the window of movement between each round of evaluation.
